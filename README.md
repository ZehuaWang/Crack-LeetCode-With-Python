Use the native Python to crack the Leet Code. 

## Arrays and Hashing

In order to count the elements from the array, list. We can use the Counter class or Default Dict class. 

For example:

242. Valid Anagram

We are given 2 strings and to decide if they are anagrams or not. By converting these 2 strings into Counter Objects, we can easily compare if they are the same or not.

217. Contains Duplicate (User Set or Counter)

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

We can use set() to check if the list size has been reduced or use the Counter() to count if there are duplicate elements.
